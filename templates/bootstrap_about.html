<p class="lead black">Date Night is a recommendation engine for two people.

<p class="lead black">As an item-based recommendation engine, Date Night asks just for your favorite movie and your partner's favorite movie.  The site uses a predictive model to evaluate which other movies in its dataset have the highest similarity with both your selected movie and your partner's.
